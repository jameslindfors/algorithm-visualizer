Algorithm Visualizer is a fast simple way to view and interact with different sorting algorithms to gain a deeper understanding of how they work.

## Features

- Select algorithm, set speed, and watch it run.
- Html Canvas renders an animation in real time as the algorithm runs.
- Generate a new array and try a different one.

## Tech I'm Using

- [Svelete] - Frontend framework for creating web applications.
- [Tailwind] - CSS framework for rapid devlopment.
- [Wasm-Pack & Rust] - Webassembly with Rust to handle algorithm and animation logic.
- [Snowpack] - Light-weight bundler with built in support for wasm-pack and post-css.

## Motivation

When creating this project I hoped to gain a deeper understanding of different algorithms and best implementations. I also got the chance to try some technologies I was not familiar with like Webassembly and Snowpack. In the process I was able to learn Svelte, Rust, WebAssembly, and further my Html Canvas experience.
